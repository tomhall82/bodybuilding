        <div>
            <p>
                weight training as a general athletic activity was initially practiced as a means to gain strength and
                measure power in ancient Egyptian and Greek societies. These societies would primarily use stones of
                various sizes and weights (a practice that would occur in one form or another throughout history) in
                their quest for body transformation. The celebration of the human body through muscular development was,
                in fact, one of the Greek ideals.
            </p>
            <p>Physical culture (distinguishable from bodybuilding per se due to the lack of specific physical display
                as an end goal) can be traced back to 11th century India where stone dumbbell weights, known as Nals,
                were lifted by those wanting to develop their bodies to enhance health and stamina to help overcome the
                challenges of daily life. Gyms were commonplace in India during this period, and by the 16th century,
                weight training is thought to have been India's national pastime.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was to be a long period between the 16th century physical movement in India and the beginning of
                bodybuilding (defined as training and dieting to develop one's body specifically for exhibitive
                purposes) as we know it today.

            <h3>The Early Years</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Toward the end of the 19th century, weight-training took on a new meaning for many, as the ancient
                    tradition of stone-lifting, practiced initially by the Greeks and Egyptians, made way for a
                    completely new system of training, with a new end-goal. Weightlifting for entertainment purposes
                    emerged in Europe, signalling the beginning of a physical culture never before seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intention was not to develop one's physique into a glorious spectacle per se, but to thrill
                    crowds with amazing feats of strengthâ€”the professional strongman was the outcome of this intensified
                    interest in weight-training. The modern sport of weightlifting was somewhat of a natural evolution
                    from the comparatively primitive practice of stone-lifting in dark, dank dungeons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not surprisingly, weightlifting exponentially grew in popularity so much so that today the practices
                    during the early period of 1890 to 1929 would seem, at best, archaic. The practices of the late 19th
                    century strongmen included issuing challenges to fellow strongmen to see who could outlift the other
                    as they traveled from town to town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other practices included pulling carts and lifting animals, much to the amusement of onlookers. The
                    public loved to watch these men compete, possibly for the novelty value if nothing else. How their
                    physiques looked did not factor into these men's displays of physical prowess. Indeed, a protruding
                    stomach and thick, fatty limbs were commonplace among these competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symmetry and aesthetics were a foreign concept at this point. However, as the 20th century
                    approached, a man who was to bridge the gap between the overweight and unsightly strongman and the
                    bodybuilder as we know him today was to emerge.
                </p>

                    <em>Eugen Sandow</em>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Officially know as the first famous bodybuilder and the father of modern bodybuilding, Eugen Sandow
                    (born Friedrich Muller), born in 1867, immediately became a phenomenon with his unprecedented
                    combination of muscle quality and strength. He became a turn-of-the-century physical cultural icon
                    who is referred to as one of bodybuilding's greatest, even in today's climate of genetic freaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the emergence of Sandow, proponents of physical culture were trying to find new ways to
                    promote healthy lifestyles in line with the new phenomenon of weight training for the sake of
                    physical demonstration. Tired of the overweight strongman image with its lack of emphasis on correct
                    eating and high body-fat levels, they were looking for a representative who could promote the
                    chiseled physique, and the subsequent ways of achieving this look. They found their man in Sandow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sandow himself started out in Europe as a professional strongman, outdoing all other strongmen to
                    make a name for himself. He traveled to America in the 1890s to be billed as the world's strongest
                    man, travelling the country and impressing people with his extraordinary feats of strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most amazing thing about Sandow, however, was his beautifully symmetrical and densely muscular
                    physique, which eventually positioned him as the first real bodybuilder and promoter of
                    bodybuilding. Indeed, Sandow published the first bodybuilding magazine (Physical Culture), developed
                    some of the first bodybuilding machinery, and appeared in numerous books and postcards, while
                    continuing to tour America posing to sold-out audiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Sandow continued to promote bodybuilding, weight-lifting contests were officially held for the
                    first time with the World Championships in England in 1891. Weightlifting was also featured in the
                    first modern Olympic Games in 1896, in Athens, Greece. Due to Sandow's influence, sales of barbells
                    and dumbbells increased by a wide margin, and a whole bodybuilding industry was created, with Sandow
                    earning thousands of dollars a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, Sandow suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage when, according to legend, he tried to pull his car
                    from a ditch in the interests of physical display. Sandow's legacy lives on in the increasing
                    popularization of bodybuilding as a sport into the 21st century. Sandow judged the first
                    bodybuilding contest ever held, and his image is immortalized on the current Mr. Olympia statue.

            <h3>The First Bodybuilding Competition</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The first bodybuilding show, staged in 1891 and billed as "The Great Show," was developed and promoted by none other than the great Eugene Sandow.</p>
                <p>After popularizing bodybuilding though frequent strength exhibitions and posing displays across Europe and America, Sandow, 34, decided, after three years of planning, that the time was right. He would provide all Sandow students in the U.K with the opportunity to display their physiques in a competition setting replete with a full judging panel and paying audience.</p>
                <p>The contest was advertised three years in advance in the first edition of Sandow's magazine to promote the further spread of physical display and pride in one's physique. "To afford encouragement to those who are anxious to perfect their physiques," was the statement issued, and many enthusiasts took this sentiment to heart, as exemplified by the large turnout of contestants and sold-out crowd of 2000.</p>
                <p>The total prize money came to 1,000 guineas, which equated to more than $5,000 at the time. First place would receive the equivalent of $2,500 and a gold Sandow statuette, while second and third would take home silver and bronze statuettes respectively.</p>
                <p>In order to compete in this contest of contests, all competitors first had to have placed in a smaller regional showâ€”a bold move on Sandow's part at the time. However, this system proved viable, and on Saturday, September 14, 1901, England's Royal Albert Hall was packed to overflowing with spectators and competitors. Sandow believed in giving his audience their money's worth, and provided various athletic displays as a form of precompetition entertainment.</p>
                <p>These displays included wrestling, gymnastics, and fencing, and, at their completion, the real athletes, the bodybuilders, made their entrance. The bodybuilders, of which there were 60, marched to the beat of Sandow's own composition, The March of the Athletes, wearing the required costume: black tights, black jockey belt, and leopard skins.</p>
                <p>As for the physiques, the paying public was highly impressed. One journalist remarked, <em>"To stand in these men's ranks is a distinction."</em></p>
                <p>The judging criteria was stringent, and Sandow made it clear that points would be awarded for attributes other than sheer size. Indeed, Sandow was looking for symmetrically even developmentâ€”the qualities that many say are overlooked in bodybuilding today.</p>
                <p>The man judged to have had the right combination of all of these qualities was William L. Murray of Nottingham, Great Britain, who took home the gold Sandow and the title: Winner Of The World's First Big Bodybuilding Contest.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Following this contest, bodybuilding culture became increasingly widespread. Many entrepreneurs seized upon the notion of physical development, and began distributing bodybuilding equipment and literature. Bernarr Macfadden, who became referred to as the father of physical culture, sold his popular chest expander and went on to become one of the greatest physical identities on the early 20th century.</p>
                <p>Well-developed for that time, but smooth and underdeveloped by today's standards, Atlas (Real name Angelo Siciliano) became immensely popular and, through his standing as an expert on physical development, acquired the rights to a mail-order course called dynamic tension, an exercise system developed by Macfadden 20 years earlier.</p>
                <p>By the end of the 1920s, barbells, dumbbells and various other exercise devices were sold the world over as the general public grew to acknowledge the importance of becoming fit and strong. Famous bodybuilders were becoming household names, and bodybuilding contests were being held frequently. Bodybuilding finally broke free of the association with weightlifting for the purposes of getting strong, and became, for many, a worthwhile pursuit in its own right.</p>

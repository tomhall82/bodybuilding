## Accessibility

During coding I have endeavoured to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### Solved Bugs

1. Home link header not changing colour. Found due to it being a link, changed colour directly initially but the realized I could set “color: inherit;” like suggested in the modules.
1. Unable to get Sandow image to show – had missed “/” between the “..” and “images” so had “background: url("..images/Sandow_Trophy.jpeg") no-repeat center center/cover;” where it should have been “background: url("../images/Sandow_Trophy.jpeg") no-repeat center center/cover;”
1. H2 background wasn’t being opaque due to being doubled up on h2 element and introduction class. Amended class structure(s) which resolved the issue.
1. History page was showing wrong when in landscape mode. The image would move in such a way to not longer look right. Fixed by changing center to top: 'background: url("../images/bodybuilding-over-past-100-years.jpg") no-repeat top center/cover;'
1. H3 titles were obscuring the first line of the following paragraph when using the link to jump to them. After trying moving the heading around, changing sections to divs, wrapping the whole section in a div, nothing was working. Issue was solved by added an additional '<br>' to the top of the first paragraph in each section.

### Known Bugs

1. While testing on ios devices, the deployed site has a white line approx. 2px high below the header on each page. This does not show on any other device nor when using developer tools on the deployed site.

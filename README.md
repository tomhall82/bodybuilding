  ## Accessibility

During coding I have endeavoured to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

        <h2>What is bodybuilding?</h2>
        <p>
          Bodybuilding is an art, a science, and a lifestyle. It’s about
          sculpting a masterpiece, your body, and showcasing it to the world.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          The very essence of bodybuilding is the physique. It’s not just about
          size, but also about symmetry, proportion, and aesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crafting the perfect body requires patience, precision, and a vision.
          Every rep, every set, and every meal is a brushstroke on the canvas of
          your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The “ideal body” in bodybuilding is subjective. It varies from person
          to person and depends on individual goals. However, there’s a common
          thread: an emphasis on muscle size, definition, and proportion. It’s
          not just about being big; it’s about being balanced.
        </p>

          <h2>Competition</h2>
          <p>
            Bodybuilding competitions range from local amateur shows to
            prestigious international events. Each level comes with its own set
            of challenges and rewards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The judging in bodybuilding is based on various criteria, including
            symmetry, proportion, and overall presentation. It’s not just about
            size; it’s about the complete package.

          <h4>
            Understanding the different bodybuilding divisions & competitions
            for men and women
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will first go over the main divisions in bodybuilding for men and
            women. Then, we will get into the different organizations and
            competitions for these divisions.
          </p>
          <h4>Men's Divisions</h4>
          <p>
            The are three main divisions in bodybuilding for men: Men's
            Physique, Classic Physique, and Bodybuilding.
          </p>
          <h5>Men's Physique</h5>
          <p>
            The Men's Physique division is actually relatively new. It was
            created back in 2013 for those who thought the bodybuilding
            divisions were "too big". And while it is new, it has exploded and
            is one of the most popular divisions. It makes sense considering you
            don't need nearly as much muscle mass to be in the Men's Physique
            division. Nevertheless, it is far from easy to do well in. In Men's
            Physique, you need to be muscular, very well-toned, and have great
            proportions. Posing is done in board shorts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the division, there are different classes based on height.
          </p>
          <h5>Classic Physique</h5>
          <p>
            Classic Physique is the middle ground between the Bodybuilding
            division and the Men's Physique division. They are not as big as
            those in the Bodybuilding division, but they are considerably bigger
            than the men in the Men's Physique division. The men pose in boxer
            briefs so they can show off the legs better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the division, there are different classes based on height and
            weight.
          </p>
          <h5>Bodybuilding</h5>
          <p>
            The Bodybuilding division is the most muscular division. There is no
            weight limit. Within the division are different classes based on
            weight. It doesn't matter how tall you are, it's all about weight.
            Bodybuilding divisions use a specific kind of posing trunk that
            allows the entire legs and glutes to be seen (it's almost like a
            male g-string, but the butt area is more covered).
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the bodybuilding organization, there may be different
            classes, but the above are the general divisions.
          </p>
          <h4>Womens Divisions</h4>
          <p>
            There are five main divisions in bodybuilding for women: Bikini,
            Figure, Physique, Bodybuilding and Fitness. Trying to decide which
            division you should enter will depend on your physique, development
            and goals. Each division emphasizes different levels of
            conditioning, sizes and styles.
          </p>
          <h5>Bikini</h5>
          <p>
            The bikini division is by far one of the most popular women's
            divisions. Because this bodybuilding division requires less muscular
            development it appeals to a wider variety of women. It’s perfect for
            those with the following genetics - small waist, curvy structure and
            long, shapely legs.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the judges are looking for curvy, balanced physiques that have
            some muscle tone. But also an overall physical appearance and
            charisma.
          </p>
          <h5>Figure</h5>
          <p>
            The focus of this division is on a developed physique. The goal is
            to achieve muscular symmetry and proportion. Competitors should have
            good muscularity, with separation but not excessively lean. This
            division is best for those with the following genetics - wide
            shoulders and a small waist. For women if you carry more muscle
            naturally this is likely the best choice.
          </p>
          <h5>Physique</h5>
          <p>
            The women's physique division is perfect for those who find it easy
            to pack on muscle and achieve a higher level of muscle development.
            Judges look for symmetry, shape, proportion, muscle tone, and poise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Competitors will perform a 90-second individual posing routine to
            music as part of the final judging.
          </p>
          <h5>Fitness</h5>
          <p>
            You’ll often find gymnasts, cheerleaders, and dancers within this
            division - they have the muscle definition strength and have a
            routine to show off both. Unlike the Figure and Physique division,
            where your muscles are more for show, the Fitness division is about
            strength. You’ll perform a unique fitness routine, whether it’s
            dance, strength moves, or gymnastics to the music of your choice.
          </p>
          <h5>Bodybuilding</h5>
          <p>
            This division is for those that love building serious muscle mass.
            Competitors will be somewhat of a total package with a balance in
            size, symmetry, and muscularity. This is by far the most difficult
            division, and it takes a tremendous amount of dedication to build,
            maintain and perfect your physique and routine. It's arguably the
            least popular for women as well due to the perception of the looks
            the women achieve to enter into this class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like with men, some organizations will have different classes, such
            as the somewhat newly introduced Wellness division in the IFBB and
            NPC. More on this below in the respective organizations.

        <h2>Diet & Supplementation</h2>
        <p>
          Nutrition plays a pivotal role in bodybuilding. Diet is the foundation
          upon which a great physique is built. It provides the fuel for
          workouts, aids in recovery, and helps in muscle growth. Without the
          right nutrition, even the best training program will fall short.
        </p>
        <p>
          Planning meals and tracking macros ensure that you’re getting the
          right nutrients in the right proportions. It’s not just about eating
          clean; it’s about eating smart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supplements can give bodybuilders that extra edge. From protein
          powders to pre-workouts, they can enhance performance, aid recovery,
          and support muscle growth. But remember, they’re called supplements
          for a reason; they’re meant to supplement a balanced diet, not replace
          it.

        <h2>Bodybuilding Community</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most rewarding aspects of bodybuilding is the sense of
          camaraderie. Whether it’s spotting a fellow lifter at the gym, sharing
          nutrition tips, or cheering each other on at competitions, the bonds
          formed are unbreakable.
        </p>
        <p>
          While bodybuilding can be a solo sport, a training partner or coach
          can really accelerate your progress. Having someone to guide,
          motivate, and push you can make all the difference. From sharing
          exercises, diet and general training tips and tricks to helping you
          safely complete a heavy exercise (also known as spotting), having a
          training partner or friends in the gym is invaluble.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it can often be difficult to find someone who trains at a
          similar time, has similar goals or is even open to having a training
          partner! This is why we have included our "Find a Buddy" page to help
          you find a training partner whether it's for occasional sessions or
          full time. For more information click <a href="buddy.html">here</a>.
